## Talk Themes

The [S6 slideshow templates / machinery / kit](http://slidekit.github.io)
lets you theme your talks.
Built-in themes include:


### Blank

Use heading 1 (e.g. `#`) for slide breaks or
use the `<!-- @SLIDE -->` directive for slide breaks without titles
(e.g. for slides with images only). Example:

```
---

# Breakfast

# In the evening

# Going to sleep

```

To change the colors, typography, etc.
see the styles in `css/blank.scss`.


### Blank5

Use heading 1 (e.g. `#`) for the title (note: gets auto-added :-) from the front matter),

use the `<!-- @SLIDE -->` directive for slide breaks without titles
(e.g. for slides with images only). Example:
